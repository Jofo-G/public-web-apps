This is my TaskerProject.

In this web app you can create multiple tasker objects in which you can add tasks. 
You can add other users to these taskers and share/cooperate on tasks.

There is also an admin role to which you can log in trough:

email: admin@admin.com
username: admin
password: admin1

But you have to connect to my app trough the server im hosting it on.
I host this app on url: https://todoapp-64a1c.web.app
