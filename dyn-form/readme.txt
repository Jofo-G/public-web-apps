This is a dynamic form project, which dynamically renders a form based on the definition.

RUNNING:
    If you wish to start the server together with backend run "run.sh" which installs all the necessary modules and then
starts up the frontend server trough "npm start" and the backend server through "node app.js".

    You can also do this manually, by running the npm install and npm start in the frontend directory and running the
npm install and node app.js in the backend directory

MODIFY FORM:
    If you wish to change the form, modify the form.json file located in ./backend/database/
